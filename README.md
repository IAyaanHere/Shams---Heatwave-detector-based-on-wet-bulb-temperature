# Shams---Heatwave-detector-based-on-wet-bulb-temperature
I'm thrilled to introduce Shams, a name derived from the Arabic word for "sun." Shams is a groundbreaking heatwave detector that I developed using the innovative concept of wet bulb temperature.   Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on temperature, Shams accurately measures heatwaves by considering both temperature and humidity.

Key features:

    Real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API
    Accurate heatwave warnings based on wet bulb temperature (safe limit: <30°C)

Recent alarming data:

    Sholapur: 40°C + 53% humidity = 31.54°C wet bulb
    Jalgaon: 46.8°C + 29% humidity = 30.72°C wet bulb

Shams is still in its early stages and needs a sleek interface. If you’re passionate about climate tech and want to contribute, let’s collaborate!

Join me in revolutionizing how we detect and respond to heatwaves.
