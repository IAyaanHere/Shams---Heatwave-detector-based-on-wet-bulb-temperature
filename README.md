# Shams---Heatwave-detector-based-on-wet-bulb-temperature
I'm thrilled to introduce Shams, a name derived from the Arabic word for "sun." Shams is a groundbreaking heatwave detector that I developed using the innovative concept of wet bulb temperature.   Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on temperature, Shams accurately measures heatwaves by considering both temperature and humidity.
