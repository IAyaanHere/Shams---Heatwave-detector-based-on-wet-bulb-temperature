                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-500">Welcome to Shams, your go-to heatwave tracker! We're all too familiar
                        with the sweltering conditions of summer, but what really makes a heatwave? According to the
                        Indian Meteorological Department, it's not just about the numbers on the thermometer. While
                        temperatures exceeding 40°C in the plains, 37°C near the sea, and 30°C in the hills are defining
                        thresholds, what truly determines the intensity of the heat is the interplay of temperature and
                        humidity.

                        Consider this: at 38°C in Mumbai, a coastal city, you might feel hotter than at 40°C in Delhi, a
                        plain city. Why? Because in Mumbai, humidity prevents your sweat from evaporating, hindering
                        your body's ability to cool down. Enter wet bulb temperature, a metric that accounts for both
                        temperature and humidity. Internationally, a wet bulb temperature below 30°C is considered safe,
                        with a maximum threshold of 35°C. However, in high-humidity regions, this limit can be
                        significantly lower.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-500">Recent data from Indian cities like Sholapur and Jalgaon highlights
                        the importance of monitoring wet bulb temperature. While traditional heatwave warnings focus
                        solely on temperature, ignoring humidity poses a significant risk. There may already be
                        heatwaves nearing the limits of human survivability, unnoticed and unmonitored. At Shams, we
                        believe in keeping you informed and safe amidst rising temperatures by acessing your location data and make live calculations on that.</p>
